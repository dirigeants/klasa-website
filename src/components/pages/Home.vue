						Klasa is not maintained anymore; here's why:
					</strong>
				</h2>
				Due to the differences between us, the community, and one of the ex-Core Developers,
				Dirigeants and all its projects are now unable to be maintained, as most of the active
				contributors and Core Developers were banned from the Discord server.
				<br>
				We recommend you look for another framework to use. You may still use Klasa as is,
				but you're doing so at your own risk, and <b>we will not be able to provide support or bug fixes</b>.
				<br>
				We'd like to thank everyone who contributed to our projects, and our community!
				It's sad to see Klasa and Dirigeants come to an end, however, as it stands, our hands are tied.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you'd like a recap about this incident, we recommend you read its chain of events, as recorded by
				Vladdy#0002 (one of the primary Core Developers of Dirigeants before the incident), <a href="https://gist.github.com/vladfrangu/835100b815470e3341f40601aefd3d10"> found here</a>

						<h5><strong>About:</strong></h5>
						<p>
							Klasa is an OOP discord.js bot framework which aims to be the most feature complete,
							while feeling like a consistent extension of <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/">
								discord.js
							</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Originally based on Komada, Klasa has become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus">
								ship of Theseus
							</a> and so much more.
							You can only vaguely see similarities between the two frameworks anymore...
